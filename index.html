          Hi, I'm Rob! <br /> I build blinky lights, retro home automation, and your next project.

        <p>
          I love creating whimsical experiences for people using my skills in
          embedded engineering & software architecture.

            <p>I help technology companies with <span class="highlight">taking their idea from a napkin to a prototype or a production-ready product</span>. I’m most passionate about creating playful physical one-off or small scale products that bring joy into lives of people who enjoy them. </p>
            <p>To bring your idea to life, I use my wide range of experience in <span class="highlight">custom circuit design (Eagle) & PCB manufacturing</span>, Raspberry Pi and Arduino, IoT and home automation as well as <span class="highlight">RF-based devices (WiFi, Bluetooth) or 3D modelling and printing (Fusion 360)</span>.  Having spent most of my life building complex, scalable and secure web applications, I can also help with software architecture and writing both embedded and web software in <span class="highlight">C, Python or JavaScript</span>. </p>
            <p>When working with clients, I always strive to bring more to the table: not only building your idea, but also being a <span class="highlight">partner that helps you navigate the technical tradeoffs</span> or helps you tackle a difficult challenge. Drawing from my experience working in agile teams in a fast-paced and deadline-driven environment, I can deliver your project on time individually or collaborate with your team.</p>
            <p>I specialise in using technology to <span class="highlight">make ordinary items come to life</span>: be it an interactive element of a set design for your next play, venue for your event, location of your cocktail club or just something to make your office bring more joy. </p>
            <p>If your project requires skills that I haven’t acquired yet - reach out anyway, there is a good chance I know someone who has.</p>
