            <p>I help creative companies with <span class="highlight">bringing their ideas from a napkin to a prototype or a production-ready product</span>. I’m most passionate about creating playful physical products and installations that bring joy into people's lives.</p>
            <p>I have a wide range of experience in <span class="highlight">custom circuit and PCB design with Eagle</span>, hardware manufacturing, Raspberry Pi and Arduino, <span class="highlight">IoT and home automation</span> as well as CAD modelling with Fusion 360 and 3d-printing. Having come to hardware via a career in building complex, scalable and secure web applications, I'm also available for software architecture and writing both embedded and web software in <span class="highlight">C, C++, Python, and JavaScript</span>. </p>
            <p>When working with clients, I always bring something more to the table: I don't just build your idea, but act as a <span class="highlight">partner who helps you navigate technical tradeoffs</span> and tackle difficult challenges. Drawing from my experience working in agile teams in fast-paced and deadline-driven environments for most of my working life, I can deliver your project on time individually or collaborate directly with your team.</p>
            <p>I specialise in using technology to <span class="highlight">make ordinary items come to life</span>: be it an interactive element of a set design for your next play, an installation for your venue, or just a little something to make your office bring more joy.</p>
            <p>If your project requires skills that I haven’t acquired yet - reach out anyway, there is a good chance I know someone who has.</p>

              Hi, I'm Rob Kirberich! I studied Electrical Engineering in Germany, and
              worked as a Software Engineer for 10 years while working on hardware side projects
              before pivoting to work on hardware full-time. I currently live in London.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm available to work with a small number of selected clients.
              If you're looking for help, reach out! I'm always happy to have a chat.
